## Web File Manager

WFM is a simple Go / React application for easily hosting static files that you want to share privately with individuals. Perhaps you are a photographer and want to send a ZIP file with photos to a client, or maybe you need to share a family video that is way too large to send by email. Just create a folder in WFM and share the link!

### Features

- Folders are private - you decide who to share them with!
- Content can be browsed using the built-in viewer or downloaded
- Images can be displayed in an automatically generated gallery
- Videos can be played in an HTML5 web player
